This project will be used to store and share python commands developed for the
Raspberry Pi. 

the first program is morse.py and it converts a text message to morse code. It
then causes an LED connected to GPIO 17 to flash. I *may* enhnace it to use
pygame to also create sound, but that will have to go in a future release.
